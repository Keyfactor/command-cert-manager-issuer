                  A reference to a K8s kubernetes.io/basic-auth Secret containing basic auth

                  be in the same namespace as the referent. If the
                  referent is a ClusterIssuer, the reference instead refers to the resource

                  The audience value used when requesting a Bearer token from an ambient token provider implied
                  by the environment, rather than by commandSecretName. For example, could be set to
                  https://example.com when requesting an access token from Google's identity token provider. Ideally, this should be
                  the URL of your Command environment. Has no effect on OAuth 2.0 Client Credential configuration - please specify
