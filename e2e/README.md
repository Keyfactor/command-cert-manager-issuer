# End-to-End Test Suite

This is a test suite intended to make it easy to run tests on the command-cert-manager-issuer project. This suite can test the local changes of the command issuer, and it is able to test existing Docker images.

This is currently configured as a Bash script, so it is necessary to run this on a UNIX-compatible machine.

Instructions on how to run the e2e test suite are within the [run_tests.sh](./run_tests.sh) file.
